            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou that are of the Free-borne People of this Land, I speak to none else, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Army, and the true <hi>English</hi> Interest, all men else have forfeited their Freedomes. I am full of anguish and trouble for your sakes, when I behold this Day. I fear you are in a way to ruine your selves, unlesse the <hi>Lord</hi> be mercifull to you. The thing you meet for, troubles me not a little. 'Tis to choose a Knight, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I hoped, and I hope we all hoped, to have done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Knights by this time. The <hi>thing</hi> you meete to choose troubles me more. This Fellow that was a Lord, this <hi>Pembroke,</hi> this <hi>Montgomery,</hi> this <hi>Herbert,</hi> this what-shall I call him? call him what you will: We were promised a Representative to begin on <hi>June</hi> next, and this Parliament to end the last of this Month; If so, why should we send this Fellow thither to make Mouthes for three Weekes, and talke of Dogs and Hawkes? I say, let us have the Representative, or we are cheated. But if we must make one Knight more, let it not be <hi>Pembroke,</hi> He is no way fit for it. Consider him as a Lord, and none of the wisest Lords neither; and then consider how many wiser and fitter Persons,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165045:3"/>we have for Parliament men then ever a Lord of them all: And what a Brand it will be to Us, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to choose a Lord, such a Lord; and surely, unlesse you are fooles and mad-men, you will not choose him. Againe, consider him as a Lord, and so he is no Free-borne Commoner, and so not capable of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Is there not an Act against King and Lords? if there is, then let us have no Lords, unlesse you intend to have a King too.</p>
            <p>Let us be wise; we may see a Designe in this Lord as plaine as the Nose on his Face. He was alwayes False, False to the King that loved him, False to the Lords that sate eight yeares with him; and doe you not think He will be false to the Commons too? I warrant you. Is not <hi>Michael Oldsworth</hi> this Lords man, a Parliament man? Are not his, and other Lords Sonnes Parliament men? If he get in too, the time will come, when the House of Commons will be all <hi>Lords,</hi> and Lords sons, and Lords Servants; and then Lords will be voted up againe, and King be in request againe, which if we live to see againe, we have spun a fair Thread.</p>
            <p>If all this which I have said be true, as it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be otherwise; why should we not look on this <hi>Turn-coat</hi> Lord as a Cheat, as one that comes to betray and undoe the Free-born People, and <hi>Switch him</hi> out of the Country?</p>
            <p>I have done, If we must choose a Knight, let him not be a Lord: we doe not read in all the Scripture of any Lord was ever chosen Knight of the Shire for <hi>Barkshire.</hi> But rather let us choose none at all, and unanimously Petition the Parliament to dissolve, that the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may succeed, and none but our selves have any share in the Gubernation and Government of this Common-wealth.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was not the <hi>old Fashion</hi> to make Speeches before you chose your Knights, but I hope you like it the better for not being <hi>Old,</hi> I am sure I doe; Give us <hi>old Fashions</hi> againe, we must have <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> our <hi>Old</hi> Religion, and <hi>Old</hi> Lawes, and a hundred things <hi>Older</hi> then <hi>Adam.</hi> I hate any thing that's <hi>Old,</hi> unlesse it be an <hi>Old man,</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> was an <hi>Old man,</hi> and so am I, and I hate my self for being an Old man, and therefore will love you, if you'le make me a new Knight. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that spake before me, I know not where to have him, He is an <hi>Individuum vagum.</hi> He is angry the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative goes not on: He is angry the Parliament goes not off; He is angry I am a Lord; He is angry I would be none; He is angry I seek to be your Knight, and he would have me of that sort of Seekers, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seek nor finde: and he concludes, I am not to be chosen because no Free-borne Commoner. I fear he is a Jesuite by his subtle Arguments: But though I have no <hi>Logick,</hi> I hope I have <hi>Reason,</hi> to answer him, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you.</p>
            <p>I Answer, I am a Free-born-Commoner. All those three words fit me. First,<lb/> I am Borne.</p>
            <p>Else how came I hither into the world?</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:165045:4"/>
            <p> I am Free.<lb/> My Accounts for last yeares expence came to fix and twenty thousand pounds, that's faire you'l say, and when you have chosen me your Knight, I'le carry you every Mothers Son, the whole County, into <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and we'le be merry, and Hunt and Hawke, and I'le be as free as an Emperour. So I am Free-borne.</p>
            <p>I am a Commoner.<lb/> Have I been so often at <hi>Common-Councels,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Halls</hi> to be accounted no Commoner? Are not the Lords all turn'd a grasing? was not I a <hi>Common swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> before I went to Lectures, and a <hi>common sleeper</hi> ever since, and am not I Chancellour of <hi>Oxford</hi> where all are Commoners? So I am a Commoner.</p>
            <p>I am no Lord.<lb/> If I am, why should I come hither to be Knight of your Shire? But though I am a Lord, is not <hi>Fairfax</hi> so? And yet he is a Parliament man, &amp; is not <hi>BRADSHAW</hi> LORD PRESIDENT? But I am no Lord. For, I am for the Parliament; I am for Voting down the House of Lords, And to tell you truth, I never loved the <hi>King</hi> fince He was <hi>Dead,</hi> and those that are Lords goe in Black for Him, but I keep my old Blue still, and my <hi>Diamond Hatband,</hi> though the <hi>Crown-Jewels</hi> are sold. Therefore you may choose me well enough.</p>
            <p>You must choose me.<lb/> Why came I hither else? why did <hi>Cromwell</hi> bid me come hither? and I bid my Steward come hither to lay in Provision, and gather Voyces. If my Stewards Bill be right, every throat that Votes for me, costs me twenty pound.</p>
            <p>Choose me if you would have a Representative. I that have beene Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> two Counties, may well represent one.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:165045:4"/>
            <p> Choose me if you would have no Representative. For I'le doe and Vote what you list, and so Choosing me, you choose your selves. So that whether you would have a Representative or no, the best way is to choose me.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you by the way, now the Parliament is fallen into the happy way of making Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let them continue. This is one of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you have by loosing the KING: You may have an Act of Parliament for what you please; and that's better then an Ordinance, and lasts longer, for an Ordinance of Parliament was good no longer then this Parliament, which though it last for ever, an Act lasts longer, because that lasts for ever, whether the Parliament last or no.</p>
            <p>For my Religion.<lb/> Who questions it? I never changed it, I was for Bishops when there were Bishops; and I was for Visitors when there were none. It is well known I am an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and had beene so twenty yeares agoe had it not beene for <hi>Michael Oldsworth,</hi> and will be so as long as the Parliament please; I have been an <hi>Old Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi> and that's an <hi>Old Court,</hi> and the highest <hi>Court,</hi> and old Courtiers alwayes love to follow the new Fashions, That Religion is in fashion now.</p>
            <p>I am Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which is hard by, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore choose me: Some of you have Sonnes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens there, all that are a Kinne to any that give their voyces for me, shall be Heads of Colledges, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Christ Church, though there be a hundred of them. The rest of you shall have the Leases of all the University Lands amongst you; what, am not I Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour?</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165045:5"/>
            <p> The Place I stand for, is, Knight of the Shire. None but Kings can make Knights, make me your Knight, you are all Kings: And it will be an Honour to me, and my Posterity to have it recorded, I was the first Lord that was Knighted by so many Kings.</p>
            <p>I know now, you cannot but choose me, I knew so before I came hither, and therefore I thank you before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and invite you Home.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with that very <hi>Exordium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Wray</hi> in his first Speech before his eight.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a <hi>famous Gentleman</hi> that was of this Parliament, concluded his Speech upon the like occasion. <hi>Behold your Knight.</hi>
